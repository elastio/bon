# bon website

This folder contains the source code and markdown files that comprise the [bon website](https://elastio.github.io/bon/).

The website is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). It's a simple and elegant framework for static websites that hides a lot of complexity from you. You don't need to be a TypeScript expert let alone a Vue expert to get around this directory.

## Local server with hot reloading

If you want to make changes to the website, you need to be able to preview the updated web pages locally.

First, make sure you have [NodeJS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Then install the dependencies of the website with the following command. This command needs to be run inside the `website` directory.

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can run the local server with the following command inside of the `website` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Consult [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) docs for help if you need any.
