# Alternatives

There are several other existing alternative crates that generate builders. `bon` was designed with many lessons learned from them. Here is a table that compares the builder crates with some additional explanations below.

## Function builder fallback paradigm

The builder crates `typed-builder` and `derive_builder` have a bunch of attributes that allow users to insert custom behavior into the building process of the struct. However, `bon` and `buildstructor` avoid the complexity of additional config attributes for advanced use cases by proposing the user to fallback to defining a custom function with the `#[builder]` attached to it where it's possible to do anything you want.

However, `bon` still provides some simple attributes for common use cases to configure the behavior without falling back to a more verbose syntax.

## Special setter methods for collections

Other builder crates provide a way to generate methods to build collections one element at a time. For example, `buildstructor` even generates such methods by default:

```rust
#[derive(buildstructor::Builder)]
struct User {
    friends: Vec<String>
}

fn main() {
    User::builder()
        .friend("Foo")
        .friend("Bar")
        .friend("`String` value is also accepted".to_owned())
        .build();
}
```

::: tip

Why is there an explicit `main()` function in this code snippet ðŸ¤”? It's a long story explained in a [blog post](../../blog/the-weird-of-function-local-types-in-rust) (feel free to skip).

:::

This feature isn't available today in `bon`, but it's planned for the future. However, it won't be enabled by default, but rather be opt-in like it is in `derive-builder`.

The problem of this feature is that a setter that pushes an element into a collection like that may confuse the reader in case if only one element is pushed. This may hide the fact that the member is actually a collection called `friends` in plural. However, this feature is still useful to provide backwards-compatibility when changing the type of a member from `T` or `Option<T>` to `Collection<T>`.

Alternatively, `bon` provides a separate solution. `bon` exposes `bon::vec![]`, `bon::map!{}`, and `bon::set![]` macros that include automatic `Into` conversion for every item. So in `bon` syntax it would look like this:

```rust
use bon::builder;

#[builder]
struct User {
    friends: Vec<String>
}

User::builder()
    .friends(bon::vec![
      "Foo",
      "Bar",
      "`String` value is also accepted".to_owned(),
    ])
    .build();
```

Another difference is that fields of collection types are considered required by default, which isn't the case in `buildstructor`.
