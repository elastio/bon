## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0) - 2024-09-08

See the [blog post for this release](https://elastio.github.io/bon/blog/bon-builder-v2-2-release) that describes some of the most notable changes in detail.

### Changed

- The `#[bon::builder]` attribute was deprecated on structs. The new [`#[derive(bon::Builder)]`](https://elastio.github.io/bon/reference/builder) should be used to derive a builder from a struct. Starting with `bon` 2.3 (next minor release) all usages of `#[bon::builder]` on structs will generate deprecation warnings. ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99)).

  There is a CLI to assist in migrating to the new syntax. See the [release blog post](https://elastio.github.io/bon/blog/bon-builder-v2-2-release#derive-builder-syntax-for-structs) for details about that.

### Added
- Add the top-level `#[builder(derive(...))]` attribute to be able to derive `Clone` and `Debug` for the builder type itself ([#113](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/113))

- Add support for conditional compilation with `cfg/cfg_attr` ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99))

### Fixed
- Fix developer experience in Rust Rover. The new `#[derive(Builder)]` syntax should now be easier for Rust Rover to analyze ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99))
- Fix a bug where a member of opaque `Option` type (i.e. the `Option` type that was renamed to make the builder macro not detect it as `Option`) was still optional. ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99))
- Fix code generation for structs with default values for generic parameters ([#108](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/108))

## [2.1.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) - 2024-09-03

### Added
- Set MSRV to 1.70.0. Note that we plan to set an even lower MSRV. This is just an initial attempt to define the MSRV that should be good enough in the meantime while we work on lowering it even more ([#101](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/101))

### Fixed
- Fix lints triggered by generated code such as `private_bounds`, `clippy::missing_const_for_fn` ([#101](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/101))
- Add more context to the messages such that it's clear what member isn't set in Rust Analyzer error messages ([#98](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/98))

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0) - 2024-09-01

See the [blog post for this release](https://elastio.github.io/bon/blog/bon-builder-v2-1-release) that describes some of the most notable changes in detail.

### Fixed
