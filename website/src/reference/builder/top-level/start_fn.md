# `start_fn`

**Applies to:** <Badge text="structs"/> <Badge text="functions"/> <Badge text="methods"/>

Overrides name, visibility and docs for the starting function.

::: tip

Don't confuse this with the [member-level](../member/start_fn) `#[builder(start_fn)]` attribute.

:::

When this attribute is used with `fn` syntax, it additionally [exposes the original function](#exposing-original-function) under the macro.

**Short syntax** configures just the *name*.

```attr
#[builder(start_fn = custom_name)]
```

**Long syntax** provides more flexibility. All keys are optional.

```attr
#[builder(
    start_fn(
        name = custom_name,
        vis = "pub(crate)",
        doc {
            /// Custom docs
        }
    )
)]
```

## `name`

The default name for the starting function is chosen according to the following rules:

| Syntax                         | Default
|--------------------------------|----------
| `struct T`                     | `builder`
| Associated `fn` `T::new()`     | `builder`
| Associated `fn` `T::fn_name()` | `{fn_name}`
| Free `fn fn_name()`            | `{fn_name}`

## `vis`

The visibility must be enclosed with quotes. Use `""` or [`"pub(self)"`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html#pubin-path-pubcrate-pubsuper-and-pubself) for private visibility.

The default visibility is the same as the visibility of the [`builder_type`](./builder_type#vis), which in turn, defaults to the visibility of the underlying `struct` or `fn`.

## `doc`

Simple documentation is generated by default. The syntax of this attribute expects a block with doc comments.

```attr
doc {
    /// Doc comments
}
```

## Examples

::: code-group

```rust [Short syntax]
use bon::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
#[builder(start_fn = init)] // [!code highlight]
struct User {
    id: u32
}

User::init() // [!code highlight]
    .id(42)
    .build();
```

```rust [Long syntax]
use bon::Builder;

// `User::init()` method will have `pub(crate)` visibility // [!code highlight]
// Use `vis = ""` to make it fully private instead         // [!code highlight]
#[derive(Builder)]
#[builder(start_fn(name = init, vis = "pub(crate)"))]      // [!code highlight]
pub struct User {
    id: u32
}

User::init() // [!code highlight]
    .id(42)
    .build();
```

See examples with `fn` syntax in the section below.


## Exposing original function

By default, when you place `#[builder]` on a function, that original function is modified by the macro to make it hidden, so that only builder syntax remains available. Specifically, the macro does the following by default:

- Prepends the prefix `__orig_` to the original function's name.
- Changes the visibility of the original function to private.
- Adds `#[doc(hidden)]` to the function.

If you specify the `start_fn` attribute on a function, the macro skips hiding the original function. It means the starting function no longer replaces the original function. This way both the original positional function and the starting function with the builder syntax are exposed.

This can be used to preserve backwards compatibility for code that uses the original function directly.

::: tip NOTE

The [`name`](#name) parameter is **required** when `start_fn` is used with `fn` syntax.

:::

**Example:**

::: code-group

```rust [Function]
use bon::builder;

#[builder(start_fn = example_builder)] // [!code ++]
fn example(x: u32, y: u32) {}

// The original positional function is still available
example(1, 2);

// The builder syntax is also available under the given name
example_builder()
    .x(1)
    .y(2)
    .call();
```

```rust [Method]
use bon::bon;

struct Example;

#[bon]
impl Example {
    #[builder(start_fn = builder)]
    fn new(x: u32, y: u32) -> Self {
        Example
    }

    #[builder(start_fn = method_builder)]
    fn method(&self, x: u32, y: u32) {}
}

// The original method `new` is still available
Example::new(1, 2);

// The builder syntax is also available under the given name
let example = Example::builder()
    .x(1)
    .y(2)
    .build();

// The original `method` is still available
example.method(1, 2);

// The builder syntax for the `method` is also available under the given name
example.method_builder()
    .x(1)
    .y(2)
    .call();
```

:::

One interesting quirk is that by default the associated method named `new` already generates a starting function under the name `builder`. However, by default, the original method `new` also becomes hidden. By specifying the `#[builder(start_fn = builder)]` explicitly the original method `new` remains exposed.

---

Given that `#[builder(start_fn)]` on a function behaves *[additively](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification)*, you can provide builder syntax as an opt-in cargo feature of your crate.

**Example:**

```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "bon", bon::builder(start_fn = function_builder))]
fn function() {}
```

If you use this syntax, the `function()` always remains available with or without the `bon` feature enabled.
