# `builder_type`

**Applies to:** <Badge text="structs"/> <Badge text="functions"/> <Badge text="methods"/>

Overrides name, visibility and docs for the builder struct.

**Short syntax** configures just the *name*.

```attr
#[builder(builder_type = CustomName)]
```

**Long syntax** provides more flexibility. All keys are optional.

```attr
#[builder(
    builder_type(
        name = CustomName,
        vis = "pub(crate)",
        doc {
            /// Custom docs
        }
    )
)]
```

## `name`

The default name for the builder struct is chosen according to the following rules:

<!-- #region name -->

| Syntax                             | Default
| -----------------------------------|------------------------
| `struct T`                         | `{T}Builder`
| Associated `fn` `T::new/builder()` | `{T}Builder`
| Associated `fn` `T::fn_name()`     | `{T}{FnName}Builder`
| Free       `fn` `fn_name()`        | `{FnName}Builder`

<!-- #endregion name -->

## `vis`

The visibility must be enclosed with quotes. Use `""` or [`"pub(self)"`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html#pubin-path-pubcrate-pubsuper-and-pubself) for private visibility.

The default visibility is the same as the visibility of the underlying `struct` or `fn`.

## `doc`

Simple documentation is generated by default. The syntax of this attribute expects a block with doc comments.

```attr
doc {
    /// Doc comments
}
```

## Examples

::: code-group

```rust [Struct]
use bon::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
#[builder(builder_type = MyBuilder)] // [!code highlight]
struct Brush {}

let builder: MyBuilder = Brush::builder();
```

```rust [Function]
use bon::builder;

#[builder(builder_type = MyBuilder)] // [!code highlight]
fn brush() {}

let builder: MyBuilder = brush();
```

```rust [Method]
use bon::bon;

struct Brush;

#[bon]
impl Brush {
    #[builder(builder_type = MyBuilder)] // [!code highlight]
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }
}

let builder: MyBuilder = Brush::builder();
```

You'll usually want to override the builder type name when you already have such a name in scope. For example, if you have a struct and a function with the same name both annotated with `#[derive(Builder)]` and `#[builder]`:

::: code-group

```rust compile_fail [Errored]
use bon::{builder, Builder};

#[derive(Builder)] // [!code error]
struct Brush {}

#[builder] // [!code error]
fn brush() {}

// `BrushBuilder` builder type name was generated for both
// the struct and the function. This is a compile error
let builder: BrushBuilder = Brush::builder();
let builder: BrushBuilder = brush();
```

```rust [Fixed]
use bon::{builder, Builder};

#[derive(Builder)]
#[builder(builder_type = MyBuilder)] // [!code highlight]
struct Brush {}

#[builder]
fn brush() {}

// Now builder types are named differently
let builder: MyBuilder = Brush::builder();
let builder: BrushBuilder = brush();
```
