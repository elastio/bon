and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.6.2](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.6.1...v3.6.2) - 2025-04-20

### Other

- Fix visibility and `const` token order in generated by `#[builder(const)]` ([#288](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/288))
- Propagate `#[target_feature]` attributes on `#[builder]`-generated finishing functions ([#284](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/284))

## [3.6.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.6.0...v3.6.1) - 2025-04-15

### Fixed

- Propagate `#[track_caller]` to the generated finishing function from the underlying function/method ([#282](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/282)). Thanks [@Lilyyy411](https://github.com/lilyyy411) for the contribution!

## [3.6.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.5.2...v3.6.0) - 2025-04-13

### Added

- Add very limited support for `#[builder(const)]` ([#279](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/279)).
  See the updated docs [here](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/const)

## [3.5.2](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.5.1...v3.5.2) - 2025-04-09

### Fixed

- Small fix for rust-analyzer syntax highlighting of parameters for functions annotated with `#[builder]` ([#275](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/275)).
  This doesn't fix the problem fully since function parameters are now assigned "variable" semantic token type instead of "parameter". However, it's already better than "struct" that they were assigned before this fix. Created an issue in rust-analyzer with more details and to get the full fix of this problem: [rust-lang/rust-analyzer#19556](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/19556).
- Fix lints on nightly 2025-03-20 ([#272](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/272))

## [3.5.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.5.0...v3.5.1) - 2025-03-19

### Fixed

- Delay the privatizing (i.e. renaming of the original function to `__orig_{fn_name}`) until after all other macros are expanded ([#269](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/269)). Also removed the warnings for `#[tracing::instrument]` users introduced in [#264](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/264). This is because with this patch there will be no difference whether you place `#[tracing::instrument]` after or before the `#[builder]` attribute - all other proc macros on the function will see the original function name.

## [3.5.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.4.0...v3.5.0) - 2025-03-16

### Added

- Introduce `setters(doc(default(skip)))` attribute to skip the inclusion of the default value in the generated docs for setters ([#265](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/265)). See the updated docs [here](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/setters#doc-setters-default-skip).

### Fixed

- Trigger a compiler warning if `#[tracing::instrument]` is placed after the `#[builder]` instead of before ([#264](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/264)). This should prevent the papercut where `tracing::instrument` assigns the span name with the ugly `__orig_` prefix in the name.
- Fix repeated `#[builder]` attributes getting ignored on free functions ([#263](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/263))

## [3.4.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.3.2...v3.4.0) - 2025-03-06

### Added

- Stabilize the current [`#[builder(getter)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/getter) attribute MVP ([#251](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/251)).
  The cargo feature `experimental-getters` is no longer needed and is now no-op.
- Make `self` receiver and `start_fn` members available as official fields on the builder ([#250](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/250)).
  Check the new documentation page about [native fields](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/builder-fields#native-fields).
- Introduce `#[builder(derive(Into))]` attribute to generate an `impl From<Builder> for T` ([#248](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/248)).
  See the updated "Inspecting" guide page now known as [Derives for Builders](https://bon-rs.com/guide/basics/derives-for-builders) and the updated [`#[builder(derive)]` reference](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/derive).

### Other

- Fix a typo on the front page of the website 😳 ([#243](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/243)). Thanks [@MegaRedHand](https://github.com/MegaRedHand) for the contribution!
- Add OpenCollective funding option ([#241](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/241))
- Regular maintenance ([#244](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/244), [#246](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/246), [#249](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/249), [#253](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/253))

## [3.3.2](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.3.1...v3.3.2) - 2024-12-28

### Fixed

- Fix syntax errors caused by PascalCasification when generating code for members named `self_` ([#238](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/238))

## [3.3.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.3.0...v3.3.1) - 2024-12-23

### Fixed

- Fix `clippy::empty_enum` triggering on nightly with `feature(never_type)` enabled ([#234](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/234))

## [3.3.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.2.0...v3.3.0) - 2024-12-07

### Added

- Add `clone`, `copy`, `deref` configs support in `#[builder(getter)]` ([see new docs](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/getter#overriding-the-return-type)) ([#229](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/229))

## [3.2.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.1.1...v3.2.0) - 2024-12-01

### Added

- Add `#[builder(getter(...))]` attribute to define getters for already set members. See [Getters](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/getters) guide for details ([#222](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/222)) ([#226](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/226)). Thanks [@lazkindness](https://github.com/lazkindness) for the contribution!

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1) - 2024-11-27

### Fixed

- Make generated identifiers of private fields deterministic. This is important for the [Buck](https://github.com/facebook/buck2) build system and probably for [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as well ([#219](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/219))

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.0.2...v3.1.0) - 2024-11-24

### Added

- Add [`#[builder(field)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/field) to define custom private fields on the builder type. See [Custom Fields](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/custom-fields) guide for details ([#207](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/207))

### Other

- Internal refactoring of naming in `bon`s test suite ([#215](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/215))

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2) - 2024-11-20

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) - 2024-11-17

### Fixed

- Fix handling of lifetimes not used in fn param types ([#208](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/208))

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.3.0...v3.0.0) - 2024-11-13

See the most interesting changes described in [**Bon 3.0 Release blog post**](https://bon-rs.com/blog/bon-v3-release).

All the breaking changes are very unlikely to actually break your code that was written against the `v2` version of `bon`. 99% of users should be able to update without any migration.

### Changed

- 🎉🎉 Stabilize the builder's [typestate API](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api) allowing for custom builder extensions. This is the **main theme** of this release. This new API brings the flexibility to a whole new level 🚀 🚀 ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Improve rustdoc output. See the rustoc examples and comparison in the [Alternatives](https://bon-rs.com/guide/alternatives#generated-docs-comparison) section ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

    - Add info that the member is required or optional.

    - For members with default values show the default value in the docs.

    - For optional members provide links to `{member}(T)` and `maybe_{member}(Option<T>)` setters.

    - Remove `__` prefixes for generic types and lifetimes from internal symbols. Instead, the prefixes added only if the macro detects a name collision.

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** Reject unnecessary empty attributes e.g. `#[builder()]` or `#[builder]` with no parameters on a member ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** Reject square brackets and curly braces delimiters for `builder_type`, `finish_fn`, `start_fn` and `on` attributes syntax. Only parentheses are accepted e.g. `#[builder(finish_fn(...))]` or `#[builder(on(...))]`. This no longer works: `#[builder(finish_fn[...])]` or `#[builder(on{...})]` ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** Reject non-consecutive `on(...)` clauses. For example, the following now generates a compile error: `#[builder(on(String, into), finish_fn = build, on(Vec<_>, into))]`, because there is a `finish_fn = ...` between `on(...)` clauses. ([#155](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/155))

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** `#[builder(derive(Clone, Debug))]` now generates impl blocks that follow the behaviour of standard `Clone` and `Debug` derives in that it conservatively adds `Clone/Debug` trait bounds for all the generic types declared on the original item (struct or function). Previously no additional bounds were required on `Clone` and `Debug` impls. See the _Added_ section for details on the way to override these bounds with `#[builder(derive(Clone/Debug(bounds(...))))]` ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** The name of the builder struct generated for methods named `builder` changed from `TBuilderBuilder` to just `TBuilder` making methods named `builder` work the same as methods named `new`. ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** The type of the builder is now dependent on the order of the setters' invocation. This may only break code like the following:

    ```rust ignore
    let builder = if condition {
        Foo::builder().a(1).b(2)
    } else {
        Foo::builder().b(1).a(2)
    };

    builder.build();
    ```

    This is because the types of the builders returned from the branches are the following:

    - `FooBuilder<SetB<SetA>>` (`if` branch)
    - `FooBuilder<SetA<SetB>>` (`else` branch)

    We believe such code should generally be very rare and even if it breaks, it's easy to fix it by reordering the setter method calls. This compromise was accepted as a design tradeoff such that the builder's type signature becomes simpler, the generated documentation becomes much less noisy, it removes an annoying special case for the builder of just one member, and it improves the type-checking performance considerably compared to the previous approach that used tuples to represent the type state. ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

### Removed

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** Remove support for `#[bon::builder]` proc-macro attribute on top of a `struct`. Use `#[derive(bon::Builder)]` for that instead. This syntax has been deprecated since `2.1` and it is now removed as part of a major version cleanup ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** Remove `#[builder(expose_positional_fn = positional_fn_name)]` attribute. Use [`#[builder(start_fn = builder_fn_name)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/start_fn) instead, since this attribute works additively keeping the function with positional arguments under the attribute unchanged. ([#153](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/153))

### Added

- ⚠️ **Breaking.** Builder macros now generate additional `mod builder_name {}` where `builder_name` is the snake_case version of the name of the builder struct. This new module contains the type state API of the builder. There is a low probability that this new module name may conflict with existing symbols in your scope, so this change is marked as breaking ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(builder_type(vis = "...", doc { ... }))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/builder_type) that allows overriding the visibility and docs of the builder struct ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(finish_fn(vis = "...", doc { ... } ))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/finish_fn) that allows overriding the visibility and docs of the finishing function ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(start_fn(doc { ... }))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/start_fn) that allows overriding the docs of the starting function ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(with = closure)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/with) syntax to customize setters with a closure. If the closure returns a `Result<_, E>` the setters become fallible ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add `#[builder(with = Some)]`, `#[builder(with = FromIterator::from_iter)]`, `#[builder(with = <_>::from_iter)]` syntax support for two [well-known functions](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/with#well-known-functions) that will probably be used frequently ([#157](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/157))

- Add [`#[builder(required)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/required) for `Option` fields to opt out from their special handling which makes `bon` treat them as regular required fields. It's also available at the top-level via `#[builder(on(_, required))]` ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145), [#155](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/155))

- Add [`#[builder(crate = path::to::bon)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/crate) and `#[bon(crate = path::to::bon)]` to allow overriding the path to `bon` crate used in the generated code, which is useful for the cases when `bon` macros are wrapped by other macros ([#153](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/153))

- Add [`#[builder(state_mod)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/state_mod) to configure the builder's type state API module name, visibility and docs ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- 🔬 **Experimental.** Add [`#[builder(overwritable)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/overwritable) and `#[builder(on(..., overwritable)]` to make it possible to call setters multiple times for the same member. This attribute is available under the cargo feature `"experimental-overwritable"`. The fate of this feature depends on your feedback in the tracking issue [#149](https://github.com/elastio/bon/issues/149). Please, let us know if you have a use case for this attribute! ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(setters)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/setters) to fine-tune the setters names, visibility and docs ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(derive(Clone/Debug(bounds(...))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/derive#generic-types-handling) to allow overriding trait bounds on the `Clone/Debug` impl block of the builder ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add inheritance of `#[allow()]` and `#[expect()]` lint attributes to all generated items. This is useful to suppress any lints coming from the generated code. Although, lints coming from the generated code are generally considered defects in `bon` and should be reported via a Github issue, but this provides an easy temporary workaround for the problem ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

### Fixed

- Fix false-positive `unused_mut` lints coming from `#[builder]` on a method that takes `mut self` ([#197](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/197))
- Fix `#[cfg/cfg_attr()]` not being expanded when used on function arguments with doc comments or other attributes ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))
- Fix raw identifiers in optional/default members ([#175](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/175))

### Other

- Add graceful internal panic handling. If some `bon` macro panics due to an internal bug, the macro will try to generate a fallback for IDEs to still provide intellisense ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))
- Switch from `elastio.github.io/bon` to a custom domain `bon-rs.com` ([#158](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/158))
- Add anonymous stats with [`umami`](https://umami.is/) for the docs website ([#158](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/158))

### Docs

- Refactor the README.md and all pages in the Guide Book by simplifying them and removing redundancies ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))
- Add new pages to the Guide Book:

    - [Custom Conversions](https://bon-rs.com/guide/basics/custom-conversions) ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))

    - [Typestate API](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api) ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))

    - [Builder's Type Signature](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/builders-type-signature) ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))

    - [Custom Methods](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/custom-methods) ([#171](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/171))

    - [Optional Generic Members](https://bon-rs.com/guide/patterns/optional-generic-members) ([#173](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/173))

    - [Compilation Benchmarks](https://bon-rs.com/guide/benchmarks/compilation) ([#177](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/177))

    - Split API reference into multiple pages. The [root page](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder) now contains convenient table with short descriptions of all available configuration attributes ([#164](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/164))

    };

    builder.build();
    ```

    This is because the types of the builders returned from the branches are the following:

    - `FooBuilder<SetB<SetA>>` (`if` branch)
    - `FooBuilder<SetA<SetB>>` (`else` branch)

- Add [`#[builder(finish_fn(vis = "...", doc { ... } ))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/finish_fn) that allows overriding the visibility and docs of the finishing function ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(start_fn(doc { ... }))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/start_fn) that allows overriding the docs of the starting function ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(state_mod)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/state_mod) to configure the builder's type state API module name, visibility and docs ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- 🔬 **Experimental.** Add [`#[builder(overwritable)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/overwritable) and `#[builder(on(..., overwritable)]` to make it possible to call setters multiple times for the same member. This attribute is available under the cargo feature `"experimental-overwritable"`. The fate of this feature depends on your feedback in the tracking issue [#149](https://github.com/elastio/bon/issues/149). Please, let us know if you have a use case for this attribute! ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(setters)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/member/setters) to fine-tune the setters names, visibility and docs ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add [`#[builder(derive(Clone/Debug(bounds(...))]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/derive#generic-types-handling) to allow overriding trait bounds on the `Clone/Debug` impl block of the builder ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

- Add inheritance of `#[allow()]` and `#[expect()]` lint attributes to all generated items. This is useful to suppress any lints coming from the generated code. Although, lints coming from the generated code are generally considered defects in `bon` and should be reported via a Github issue, but this provides an easy temporary workaround for the problem ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))

### Fixed

- Fix `#[cfg/cfg_attr()]` not being expanded when used on function arguments with doc comments or other attributes ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))
- Fix raw identifiers in optional/default members ([#175](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/175))

### Other

- Add graceful internal panic handling. If some `bon` macro panics due to an internal bug, the macro will try to generate a fallback for IDEs to still provide intellisense ([#145](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/145))
- Switch from `elastio.github.io/bon` to a custom domain `bon-rs.com` ([#158](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/158))
- Add anonymous stats with [`umami`](https://umami.is/) for the docs website ([#158](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/158))

### Docs

- Refactor the README.md and all pages in the Guide Book by simplifying them and removing redundancies ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))
- Add new pages to the Guide Book:

    - [Custom Conversions](https://bon-rs.com/guide/basics/custom-conversions) ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))

    - [Typestate API](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api) ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))

    - [Builder's Type Signature](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/builders-type-signature) ([#170](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/170))

    - [Custom Methods](https://bon-rs.com/guide/typestate-api/custom-methods) ([#171](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/171))

    - [Optional Generic Members](https://bon-rs.com/guide/patterns/optional-generic-members) ([#173](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/173))

    - [Compilation Benchmarks](https://bon-rs.com/guide/benchmarks/compilation) ([#177](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/177))

    - Split API reference into multiple pages. The [root page](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder) now contains a convenient table with short descriptions of all available configuration attributes ([#164](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/164))

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.2.1...v2.3.0) - 2024-09-14

See the [blog post for this release](https://bon-rs.com/blog/bon-builder-v2-3-release) that describes some of the most notable changes in detail.

### Added

- Add support for positional params in `start_fn` and `finish_fn` ([#125](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/125))

### Fixed

- Forward lint suppression from `#[allow()/expect()]` attributes written by the user on the top-level to the generated items ([#125](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/125))
- Suppress the false-positive ([clippy issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6947)) `clippy::future_not_send` lint ([#125](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/125))
- Fix the cases where `#[builder(derive(Debug, Clone))]` didn't validate for all members to implement `Clone/Debug` if these members were of reference or generic types ([#125](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/125))

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1) - 2024-09-09

### Changed

- Lower MSRV from 1.70.0 to 1.59.0 ([#120](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/120))

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0) - 2024-09-08

See the [blog post for this release](https://bon-rs.com/blog/bon-builder-v2-2-release) that describes some of the most notable changes in detail.

### Changed

- The `#[bon::builder]` attribute was deprecated on structs. The new [`#[derive(bon::Builder)]`](https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder) should be used to derive a builder from a struct. Starting with `bon` 2.3 (next minor release) all usages of `#[bon::builder]` on structs will generate deprecation warnings. ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99)).

    There is a CLI to assist in migrating to the new syntax. See the [release blog post](https://bon-rs.com/blog/bon-builder-v2-2-release#derive-builder-syntax-for-structs) for details about that.

### Added

- Add the top-level `#[builder(derive(...))]` attribute to be able to derive `Clone` and `Debug` for the builder type itself ([#113](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/113))

- Add support for conditional compilation with `cfg/cfg_attr` ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99))

### Fixed

- Fix developer experience in Rust Rover. The new `#[derive(Builder)]` syntax should now be easier for Rust Rover to analyze ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99))
- Fix a bug where a member of opaque `Option` type (i.e. the `Option` type that was renamed to make the builder macro not detect it as `Option`) was still optional. ([#99](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/99))
- Fix code generation for structs with default values for generic parameters ([#108](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/108))

## [2.1.1](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) - 2024-09-03

### Added

- Set MSRV to 1.70.0. Note that we plan to set an even lower MSRV. This is just an initial attempt to define the MSRV that should be good enough in the meantime while we work on lowering it even more ([#101](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/101))

### Fixed

- Fix lints triggered by generated code such as `private_bounds`, `clippy::missing_const_for_fn` ([#101](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/101))
- Add more context to the messages such that it's clear what member isn't set in Rust Analyzer error messages ([#98](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/98))

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/elastio/bon/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0) - 2024-09-01

See the [blog post for this release](https://bon-rs.com/blog/bon-builder-v2-1-release) that describes some of the most notable changes in detail.

### Added

- `#[must_use]` on the `build()` method for structs and `call()` for functions (if the original function has `#[must_use]`) ([#82](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/82)). Thanks [@EdJoPaTo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo) for the contribution!

### Changed

- Optimize `bon`'s generated code type-checking performance and improve error messages ([#84](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/84))
- Improve builder() method docs ([#76](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/76)). Thanks [@EdJoPaTo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo) for the contribution!

### Fixed

- Don't warn on `clippy::impl_trait_in_params` ([#80](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/80)). Thanks [@EdJoPaTo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo) for the contribution!
- Fix typos in messages and code comments ([#79](https://github.com/elastio/bon/pull/79)). Thanks [@EdJoPaTo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo) for the contribution!
