# Documenting

In regular Rust, it's not possible to place doc comments on function arguments. But with `#[builder]` it is. Documentation written on the arguments will be placed on the generated setter methods.

**Example:**

```rust
use bon::builder;

/// Function that returns a greeting special-tailored for a given person
#[builder]
fn greet(
    /// Name of the person to greet.
    ///
    /// **Example:**
    /// ```
    /// greet().name("John");
    /// ```
    name: &str,

    /// Age expressed in full years passed since the birth date.
    age: u32
) -> String {
    format!("Hello {name} with age {age}!")
}
```

::: details How does this work? ðŸ¤”

This works because Rust compiler checks for invalid placement of `#[doc = ...]` attributes only after the macro expansion stage. `#[builder]` removes the docs from the function's arguments in the expanded code, and instead moves them to the docs on setter methods.

:::

When `#[derive(Builder)]` is placed on top of a struct, then documentation on the struct fields will be copied to the docs on the setter methods.

## Custom `doc` attributes

You can override documentation on other items generated by builder macros. There are multiple attributes accepting a `doc { ... }` block.

```rust
use bon::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
#[builder(
    builder_type(doc {
        /// Custom docs on the builder struct itself
    }),
    start_fn(doc {
        /// Custom docs on the starting function
    }),
    // ...
)]
struct Example {}
```

You can document the following items this way:

| Attribute                                                              | Documentation target
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------
| [`builder_type`](../../reference/builder/top-level/builder_type#doc)   | Builder struct
| [`start_fn`](../../reference/builder/top-level/start_fn#doc)           | Starting function
| [`finish_fn`](../../reference/builder/top-level/finish_fn#doc)         | Finishing function
| [`state_mod`](../../reference/builder/top-level/state_mod#doc)      | Builder state API module (more details in [Typestate API](../typestate-api))
| [`setters`](../../reference/builder/member/setters#doc)                | Custom docs for setters. Prevents copying them from the field/argument



## Positional members

Documentation comments are allowed on [positional members](./positional-members). However, since there are no separate setter methods generated for them, the docs on these members will not be copied anywhere, and thus they won't appear in `rustdoc`. Instead, it's recommended to write documentation for these members on the top level of the struct or function.
