# Alternatives

There are several other existing alternative crates for generating builders. `bon` was designed based on many lessons learned from them. A table that compares the builder crates with some additional explanations is below.

## Function Builder Paradigm Shift

If you ever hit a wall 🧱 with `typed-builder` or `derive_builder`, you'll have to hack something around their derive attributes syntax on a struct. With `bon` or `buildstructor` you can simply change the syntax from `#[derive(Builder)]` on a struct to a `#[builder]` on a function to gain more flexibility at any time 🤸. It is [guaranteed to preserve compatibility](./basics/compatibility#switching-between-derive-builder-and-builder-on-the-new-method), meaning it's not a breaking change.

### Example

Suppose you already had a struct like the following with a builder derive:

```rust ignore
use bon::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
pub struct Line {
    x1: u32,
    y1: u32,

    x2: u32,
    y2: u32,
}

// Suppose this is your users' code
Line::builder().x1(1).y1(2).x2(3).y2(4).build();
```

Then you decided to refactor 🧹 your struct's internal representation by extracting a private utility `Point` type:

```rust compile_fail
use bon::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
pub struct Line {
    point1: Point,
    point2: Point,
}

// Private
struct Point {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}

// Suppose this is your users' code (it no longer compiles)
Line::builder().x1(1).y1(2).x2(3).y2(4).build(); // [!code error]
//                 ^^- error[E0599]: no method named `x1` found for struct `LineBuilder` // [!code error]
//                                   available methods: `point1(Point)`, `point2(Point)` // [!code error]
```

There are two problems with `#[derive(Builder)]` syntax in this case:

1.  This refactoring becomes a breaking change to `Line`'s builder API 😢.
2.  The private utility `Point` type leaks through the builder API via `point1`, `point2` setters 😭.

The fundamental problem is that the builder's API is _coupled_ ⛓️ with your struct's internal representation. It's literally `derive`d from the fields of your struct.

### Suffering

If you were using `typed-builder` or `derive_builder`, you'd be stuck for a while trying to find the magical 🪄 combination of attributes that would let you do this change without breaking compatibility or leakage of the private `Point` type.

With no solution in sight 😮‍💨, you'd then fall back to writing the same builder manually. You'd probably expand the builder derive macro and edit the generated code directly, which, ugh... hurts 🤕.

However, that would be especially painful with `typed-builder`, which generates a complex typestate that is not human-readable and maintainable enough by hand. It also references some internal `#[doc(hidden)]` symbols from the `typed-builder` crate. Achoo... 🤧.

::: tip

In contrast, `bon`'s type state **is** human-readable, maintainable, and [documented](./typestate-api) 👍

:::

### Behold the Function-Based Builder

This change is as simple as pie 🥧 with `bon` or `buildstructor`. The code speaks for itself:

```rust
use bon::bon;

// No more derives on a struct. Its internal representation is decoupled from the builder.
pub struct Line {
    point1: Point,
    point2: Point,
}

struct Point {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}

#[bon]
impl Line {
    #[builder]
    fn new(x1: u32, y1: u32, x2: u32, y2: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            point1: Point { x: x1, y: y1 } ,
            point2: Point { x: x2, y: y2 } ,
        }
    }
}

// Suppose this is your users' code (it compiles after this change, yay 🎉!)
Line::builder().x1(1).y1(2).x2(3).y2(4).build();
```

Ah... Isn't this just so simple and beautiful? 😌 The fun part is that the constructor method `new` that we originally abandoned comes back to heroically save us ⛑️ at no cost, other than a star ⭐ on `bon`'s [Github repo](https://github.com/elastio/bon) maybe 🐈?

And you know what, our old friend `new` doesn't feel offended for being abandoned. It doesn't even feel emotions, actually 🗿. But it's happy to help you 🫂.

Moreover, it offers you a completely new dimension of flexibility:

-   Need some validation? Just make the `new()` method return a `Result`. The generated `build()` method will then become fallible.
-   Need to do an `async` operation in the constructor? Just make your constructor `async` and your `build()` will return a `Future`.
-   Need some adrenaline 💉? Just add `unsafe`, and... you get the idea 😉.

---

The chances of hitting a wall with function builders are close to zero, and even if you ever do, you still have access to the [Typestate API](./typestate-api) in `bon` for even more flexibility 💪.

## Documentation Comparison

You can compare the `rustdoc` output for builders generated by different crates. See the source code for this comparison [here].

## Special Setter Methods for Collections

Other builder crates provide a way to generate methods to build collections one element at a time. For example, `buildstructor` even generates such methods by default:

```rust
#[derive(buildstructor::Builder)]
struct User {
    friends: Vec<String>
}

fn main() {
    User::builder()
        .friend("Foo")
        .friend("Bar")
        .friend("`String` value is also accepted".to_owned())
        .build();
}
```

::: tip

Why is there an explicit `main()` function in this code snippet 🤔? It's a long story explained in a [blog post](/blog/the-weird-of-function-local-types-in-rust) (feel free to skip).

:::

This feature isn't available today in `bon`, but it's planned for the future. However, it won't be enabled by default, but rather be opt-in like it is in `derive_builder`.

The problem with this feature is that a setter that pushes an element into a collection like that may confuse the reader in case if only one element is pushed. This may hide the fact that the member is actually a collection called `friends` in the plural. However, this feature is still useful to provide backwards compatibility when changing the type of a member from `T` or `Option<T>` to `Collection<T>`.

Alternatively, `bon` provides a separate solution. `bon` exposes the following macros that provide convenient syntax to create collections.

| `Vec<T>`             | `[T; N]`             | `*Map<K, V>`         | `*Set<K, V>`         |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| [`bon::vec![]`][vec] | [`bon::arr![]`][arr] | [`bon::map!{}`][map] | [`bon::set![]`][set] |

These macros share a common feature that every element of the collection is converted with `Into` to shorten the syntax if you, for example, need to initialize a `Vec<String>` with items of type `&str`. Use these macros only if you need this behaviour, or ignore them if you want to be explicit in code and avoid implicit `Into` conversions.

```rust
use bon::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
struct User {
    friends: Vec<String>
}

User::builder()
    .friends(bon::vec![
      "Foo",
      "Bar",
      "`String` value is also accepted".to_owned(),
    ])
    .build();
```

Another difference is that fields of collection types are considered required by default in `bon`, which isn't the case in `buildstructor`.
