# `bon-sandbox`

Not a real crate! It's just a showcase of examples used by [`bon`]'s documentation to demonstrate the rustdoc output for code generated by builder macros.

Don't use this crate, it doesn't follow semver at all and serves no other purpose other than linking to its docs as an example!
