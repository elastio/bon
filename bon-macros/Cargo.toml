# This MSRV was chosen because Rust supports mixing generic type and const
# parameters only starting with this version. We require this feature for the
# cases when the builder is generated for a function or struct that uses const
# generics. The generated builder **always** appends a generic type parameter
# for the type state at the end of the Builder generics list. So for functions
# or structs that use const generics the generated builder will have a generic
# type parameter after the const generic parameter, which is only supported
# starting from Rust 1.59.0.
