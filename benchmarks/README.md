# Benchmarks

This is a collection of benchmarks for the code generated by `bon` crate.

## Dependencies

If you'd like to run the benchmarks yourself, first you need to install the following:

- `Valgrind`. It's `cachegrind` component is used by [`iai`](https://github.com/bheisler/iai) benchmark to display the instruction counts and cache/RAM hits.
- `cargo-asm`. It's used to get the resulting assembly code for the benchmarked functions.
- `gnuplot`. It's used by `criterion` to generate diagrams.

If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, just run the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
cargo install cargo-asm
sudo apt-get install -y valgrind gnuplot
```

## Running the benchmarks

Once you have all the [dependencies](#dependencies) installed you can run the select benchmark the following way:

```bash
./benchmarks/run.sh args_{N}
```

The name of the benchmark corresponds to the modules in this crate and the number `{N}` represents the number of arguments that are passed to the function.
