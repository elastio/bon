/// an explanation ðŸ˜¸. So... where to start ðŸ¤”. Ah! The problem!
///
/// ## The problem
///
/// Proc macro attributes (like `#[builder]`) see all the `#[cfg(...)]` and `#[cfg_attr(...)]`
/// attributes unexpanded. For example, if you write smth like this:
///
/// ```
/// #[bon::builder]
/// fn func(
///     #[cfg(windows)]
///     windows_only_param: u32,
/// ) {}
///
/// ```
///
/// then the `#[builder]` macro will see the full `#[cfg(...)]` attribute with
/// the `windows_only_param` it is attached to verbatim. The `#[cfg(...)]` isn't
/// removed by the time the `#[builder]`'s macro expansion is invoked.
///
/// It is a problem because the `#[builder]` macro needs to know the exact list
/// of members it has to generate setters for. It doesn't know whether
/// the `windows` predicate evaluates to `true` or `false`, especially if this was
/// a more complex predicate. So it can't decide whether to generate a setter for
/// the `windows_only_param` or not.
///
/// ## The solution
///
/// This macro allows us to evaluate the `cfg` predicates by using a variation of
/// [the trick] shared by @recatek.
///
/// When the `#[builder]` macro finds any usage of `#[cfg(...)]` or `#[cfg_attr(...)]`
/// it generates a call to this macro with all `cfg` predicates collected from the
/// item it was placed on. The `#[builder]` macro deduplicates and sorts the `cfg`
/// predicates and passes them as `$pred` to this macro.
///
/// This macro then dispatches to `__eval_cfg_callback_true` or `__eval_cfg_callback_false`
/// by defining a conditional `use ...` statement for each predicate and collects the
/// results of the evaluation in the `$results` list.
///
/// For the last call to this macro (when no more `$pred` are left) the macro calls back
/// to the proc macro attribute that called it with the results of the evaluation and
/// the original parameters and the item which are passed through via the `$rest` macro variable.
///
