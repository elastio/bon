error: expected one of the following:

       (1) no return type annotation;
           this means the closure is expected to return a value of the same type
           as the member's underlying type*;

       (2) `-> *Result<_, {{ErrorType}}>` or `-> *Result<_>` return type annotation;
           this means the closure is expected to return a `Result` where the `Ok`
           variant is of the same type as the member's underlying type*; this syntax
           allows you to define a fallbile setter (one that returns a `Result<Builder>`);

           the `_` placeholder must be spelled literally to mark the underlying type*
           of the member; an optional second generic parameter for the error type is allowed;

           the type doesn't have to be named `Result` exactly, the only requirement is
           that it must have the `Result` suffix; for example if you have a type alias
           `ApiResult<_>`, then it'll work fine;

       *underlying type is the type of the member stripped from the `Option<T>` wrapper
       if this member has an `Option<T>` type and no `#[builder(transparent)]` annotation
