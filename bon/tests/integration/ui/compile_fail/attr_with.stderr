error: expected one of the following syntaxes:
       (1) no return type annotation;
       (2) `-> Result<_, {ErrorType}>` or `-> Result<_>` return type annotation;

       in the case (1), the closure is expected to return a value of the same type as the member's type;

       in the case (2), the closure is expected to return a `Result` where the `Ok` variant is of the same type as the member's type; the `_` placeholder must be spelled literally to mark the type of the member; an optional second generic parameter for the error type is allowed
