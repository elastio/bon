# This MSRV is chosen because only starting with this version Rust supports
# mixing generic type and const parameters. We require this feature for the
# cases when builder is derived for a function or struct that uses const
# generics. The generated builder **always** appends a generic type parameter
# for the type state at the end of the Builder type generics list. So for
# functions or structs that use const generics the generated builder will have
# a generic type parameter after the const generic parameter, which is only
# supported starting from Rust 1.59.0.
