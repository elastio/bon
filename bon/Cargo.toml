# This MSRV was chosen because Rust supports mixing generic type and const
# parameters only starting with this version. We require this feature for the
# cases when the builder is generated for a function or struct that uses const
# generics. The generated builder **always** appends a generic type parameter
# for the type state at the end of the Builder generics list. So for functions
# or structs that use const generics the generated builder will have a generic
# type parameter after the const generic parameter, which is only supported
# starting from Rust 1.59.0.

# üî¨ Experimental! There may be breaking changes to this feature between *minor* releases,
# however, compatibility within patch releases is guaranteed though.
#
# This feature enables the #[builder(overwritable)] attribute that can be used to
# allow overwriting already set fields in the builder. Without this attribute it's
# not possible to set the same member twice in the builder, a compile error would be
# generated.
#
# See more info at https://bon-rs.com/reference/builder/top-level/overwritable.
#
# We are considering stabilizing this attribute if you have a use for it. Please leave
# a üëç reaction under the issue https://github.com/elastio/bon/issues/149 if you need
# this attribute. It would also be cool if you could leave a comment under that issue
# describing your use case for it.
